# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition
Real-time face detection and emotion/gender classification using fer2013/IMDB datasets with a keras CNN model and openCV.

Real-Time Emotion Recognition
Comprises of two-step process i.e. face detection
(bounded face) in image followed by emotion detection
on the detected bounded face. 
I.
Haar feature-based cascade classifiers ​ : Quick
and robust Real-Time algorithm that face in a
video. Faster in comparison to other face
detectors. 
II.
Xception CNN Model ( ​ Mini_Xception, 2017 ​ ) ​ : We
will train a CNN model architecture that takes
bounded face (48*48 pixels) as input and predicts
probabilities of 7 emotions in the output layer.
